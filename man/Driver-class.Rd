\title{Class \verb{<Driver>}}
\description{
\verb{<Driver>} is an S4 class representing spatially explicit environmental or
anthropogenic features that interact with simulated agents. These drivers
influence agentsâ€™ movement, behavioural states, energetic expenditure, and
physiological condition within the IBM's area of calculation (AOC) over the
course of a simulation.
}
\details{
The class supports four main categories of drivers:
\itemize{
\item \code{"habitat"} - represents baseline environmental or anthropogenic conditions
that define habitat characteristics (e.g. Sea surface temperature, salinity,
bathymetry, distance from land).
\item \code{"resource"}: captures the spatial distribution and availability of resources
or proxies of ecological suitability (e.g. species density maps, energy
intake surfaces).
\item \code{"disturbance"} - refers to influencers that deviate from the status-quo and
evaluated for their effects on the agents' simulated histories (e.g.
offshore windfarm footprints, oil rigs, shipping corridors).
\item \code{"model"} - refers to influencers specified for model operational purposes
(e.g. AOC bounding box to confine simulated movements).
}

\verb{<Driver>} supports two types of spatial data: vector-based simple features
(\verb{<sf>}) and gridded spatio-temporal data cubes (\verb{<stars>}), providing
flexibility for representing diverse inputs.

This class interacts with the \code{\linkS4class{Species}} to define how agents respond to drivers,
such as modifying movement patterns or altering behavioural energy costs.

\item{\code{id}}{character string, a unique identifier for the driver.}

\item{\code{descr}}{descr character string, providing a general description of the driver.}

\item{\code{ann}}{character string, annotation for referencing the driver for
reporting purposes.}

\item{\code{type}}{character string, the driver type within the context of the IBM.

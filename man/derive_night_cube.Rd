\title{Derive rasters of night-time proportion per day}
\usage{
derive_night_cube(aoc_strs, start_date, end_date, delta_time = "1 week")
}
\description{
Helper to compute a \if{html}{\out{<stars>}} datacube comprising spatio-temporal maps of
night-time proportions, within simulated AOC and over the simulated time
period
}
\details{
NOTES:
\itemize{
\item uses \code{geosphere::daylength()} which requires latitude values. Thus,
input \code{aoc_strs} object needs to be projected/resampled into "EPSG:4326" for
computations, before being projected back to its original CRS
\item Temporal dimension of returned \if{html}{\out{<stars>}} is always Date

\title{\verb{<Species>}}
\description{
\verb{<Species>} is an S4 class that comprises species-level properties of
simulated agents. It includes attributes related to taxonomy, physiology,
behavioural/activity states, responses to environmental and non-environmental
drivers, and population size.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{character string, a unique identifier for the species.}

\item{\code{common_name}}{character string, the common name of the species.}

\item{\code{scientific_name}}{character string, the scientific name of the species.}

\item{\code{body_mass_distr}}{an object of class \linkS4class{VarDist}, defining the
distribution of body mass for the species.}

\item{\code{states_profile}}{a list \linkS4class{StateSpec} objects, defining the
behavioural/activity states for the species to consider in the model.}

\item{\code{driver_responses}}{list of \linkS4class{DriverResponse} objects, specifying the
speciesâ€™ responses to predefined model drivers, such as environmental
pressures, biological influences, and human-induced impacts affecting
movement and behaviour/activity states. See \linkS4class{DriverResponse} for
details.

Each element in the \code{driver_responses} list must correspond to an existing
object of class \linkS4class{Driver}. At the initialization phase of the
Individual-Based Model (IBM), these \code{driver_responses} are matched with
their respective \linkS4class{Driver} objects to ensure a consistent and
well-defined set of species-driver interactions. Failure to provide a
corresponding \linkS4class{Driver} object for each entry of \code{driver_responses}
will result in missing or undefined driver effects during the simulation.}

\item{\code{mortality_thresh_distr}}{an object of class \linkS4class{VarDist}, specifying
the values of agent's condition (e.g. body mass), below which it is
assumed to have died (\emph{Note: slot may require further generalization})}

\item{\code{pop_size}}{numeric, the population size (i.e., number of individuals)
within the area of calculation (AOC).}

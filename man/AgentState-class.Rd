\description{
\code{AgentState} is an S4 class for specifying an agent's current state in terms
of spatio-temporal activity and physiological condition at the end of the
current simulation \code{time_step} (e.g. end of day). It stores information such
as body mass, activity budgets, energy expenditure metrics, survival status,
etc
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{location}}{object of class \code{XY}, specifying the agent's current location
(units/projection: TBD).}

\item{\code{grid_cell}}{object of class \code{XY}, indicating the spatial coordinates of
the grid-cell occupied by the agent}

\item{\code{time_step}}{integer, the current simulation time-step}

\item{\code{date}}{\code{Date} object, the calendar date of the current simulation time-step}

\item{\code{mass}}{numeric, the agent's current body mass (units: g)}

\item{\code{activity_budget}}{list, defining the agent's time-in-activity budget in
the current time-step. Each list element represents an activity and the
time the agent spends on it during this time-step (units: hours/time-step).}

\item{\code{activity_costs}}{list, specifying the energy costs associated with each
activity in argument \code{activity_budget} (units: KJ/hour/g)}

\item{\code{energy_expenditure}}{numeric, total energy spent on all activities by the
end of the current time-step (units: KJ/g)}

\item{\code{foraging_success}}{numeric, the mass of prey consumed per time-step
(units: g/time-step)}

\item{\code{mass_change_value}}{numeric, specifying the change in the agentâ€™s mass
over the time-step (units: g)}

\item{\code{mortality_prob}}{numeric, the probability of the agent dying within the
the current time-step}

\item{\code{alive}}{integer, binary indicator of the agent's survival status (\code{1} if
alive, \code{0} if dead)}

\item{\code{track}}{object of class \code{sf}, containing time-location points that
represent the agent's movement in the current time-step}

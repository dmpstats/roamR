# Overview

`roamR` is an R package that offers a toolset and framework for running Individual Based Models (IBMs - or Agent-Based Models). It was created as part of the DisNBS project (Distribution of seabirds in the Non-Breeding Season) which was a project within the Off-shore Renewables Joint Industry Partnership programme ([ORJIP](http://www.orjip.org.uk/)). While the project has specific goals in relation to Off-shore Wind Farms (OWF) and their potential effects on seabirds, the problem is quite general. This package can help build animal movement simulations, with the general problem broken down into logical components and imposes a level of transparent formality, such that the computational components are on a common footing, leaving focus on parametrisation and inputs/data.

## A scenario

IBMs are simple in principle - they simulate the movement of individual animals in response to their environment and measure properties from them e.g. their body-mass. They are particularly useful where analytical modelling is difficult and where "what-if" scenarios are sought, where the system can be examined with/without a speculative perturbation. They also accommodate stochasticity/uncertainty quite naturally. Typically many are run such that uncertainty in the inputs are reflected in any measured outputs, so conclusions are tempered accordingly.

The DisNBS project serves as a motivating example. ... etc OWF blah

## Package overview

`roamR` is written in S4 and has been structured/implemented such that the simulations are well defined, but with a lot of flexibility in what the components can do. Animal IBMs are spatio-temporal and can be based on very disparate data sources - so `roamR` is particular in its treatment of space (projections etc), time and units generally (as found in the `units` package). The package was written with animals in mind (indeed one of the main classes is `Species`), but we'll use the agnostic term __agent__.

In brief - `roamR`:

- defines the environment the animal interacts with, and how this functionally affects its movement or behaviour
- defines how animals move, with consideration of the environment, behavoural state, or condition
- defines the behaviours animals may engage in and how these change
- defines the general characteristics of a type of agent (a _species_ definition)
- creates many agents with stochastic properties in line with their species definition
- runs the agents through the simulated environment over time, for a defined temporal resolution
- measures the agents throughout the simulation
- gives tools to query the mass of agents that have been simulated

A principal limitation in IBMs is the level of information you have about how the agents behave. `roamR` is intended to work with very little information, up to very information rich. The test cases here cover a range of data support:

- Relatively data rich: Guillemots at the Isle of May, which are well studied.
- Relatively data poor: Red-Throated Divers in the North Sea, which are less understood.

In the more extreme, `roamR` has been developed with the intention of simulating very well known animal populations, for example a population with extensive GPS tagging information, that might suffice for estimation of a Hidden Markov Model. For example those demonstrated in Michelot XXX fitted to Fulmar, which could be subsequently simulated in the momentHMM package.  

## R and S4 programming

This package assumes at least some minor familiarity with R. Its use for simulating birds in the context of OWF is illustrated using markdown in the associated example scenarios - so no deep R programming is required. These examples give the steps required which can be modified and followed for new cases. However, even within this use-case it is unavoidable that user-defined functions will be required: for example the energetics equations for a particular species' activity states. There are a lot of features of the package that extend it well beyond these OWF seabird examples, but will require a deeper understanding of R.


`roamR` is written in S4 and some familiarity with this is useful generally, but particularly if you want to use the package beyond the narrow path for the bird IBMs that motivated the package. However, there is some basic S4 information that is useful to bear in mind:

* There are well-defined classes for many components of the simulation - the R objects will often contain _slots_ that you access by name with the `@` operator, as opposed to the `$` that is common for simple R objects.
* Classes are prescriptive in what they can contain, this means things are more robust but deviations will be rejected e.g. if the data is __required__ to be a `stars` object, you cannot store something else there
* There are a lot of background checks for conformity (as above), so what you do will be scrutinised at various levels and prevented if  



# Package/class hierarchy

A great deal of thought has gone into the hierarchical structure, which means mainly the classes, how they relate to one another and therefore where data (including parameters) lies within these. This is summarised in figure 1 below:

![figure 1](images/roamR_schema.png)

Key elements of this are discussed in turn, and examples are given in the associated test scenarios. Four main areas are covered:

* The simulation engine and wrapper - offering high-level controls, like the number of agents, spatial/temporal boundaries (e.g. a bounding box, as distinct to environmental constraints of the simulation, fundamental spatial coordinate system
* The species - properties of the population being simulated e.g. distributions of initial body mass, flying speeds. These are often distributional, as agents/individuals will be generate from these. 
* The environment - spatiotemporal descriptions of the agent's environment within the simulation frame e.g. natural boundaries (coast), the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over time, man-made structures (e.g. OWF)
* The agents - the basic simulation element, largely defined from higher components, but the basis of monitoring the simulation and any counterfactuals 

The workflow is in essence:

1. Configure the simulation at a high-level, including the spatial and temporal boundaries, projections, number of agents etc.
1. Define the species, for example initial body mass distributions, flight speed distributions, activity states and their energetic implications, functional relationships between the species and the environment e.g. how SST affects energy, how OWFs influence movement/distribution.
1. Define the environment, essentially anything spatio-temporal that the animals are thought to respond to - coastline, man-made structures (e.g. OWF), prey distributions, SST, bathymetry etc
1. Combine components into an IBM object
1. Run a simulation, which creates agents, moves them through the environment, and records their properties over time
1. Alter simulation elements to reflect a perturbation (presence of OWF)
1. Re-run the simulation with the perturbation
1. Query simulated animals, with counterfactuals as needed based on within-agent comparisons over perturbation scenarios

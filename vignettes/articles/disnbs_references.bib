   abstract = {Flight is a key adaptive trait. Despite its advantages, flight has been lost in several groups of birds, notably among seabirds, where flightlessness has evolved independently in at least five lineages. One hypothesis for the loss of flight among seabirds is that animals moving between different media face tradeoffs between maximizing function in one medium relative to the other. In particular, biomechanical models of energy costs during flying and diving suggest that a wing designed for optimal diving performance should lead to enormous energy costs when flying in air. Costs of flying and diving have been measured in free-living animals that use their wings to fly or to propel their dives, but not both. Animals that both fly and dive might approach the functional boundary between flight and nonflight. We show that flight costs for thickbilled murres (Uria lomvia), which are wing-propelled divers, and pelagic cormorants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) (foot-propelled divers), are the highest recorded for vertebrates. Dive costs are high for cormorants and low for murres, but the latter are still higher than for flightless wing-propelled diving birds (penguins). For murres, flight costs were higher than predicted from biomechanical modeling, and the oxygen consumption rate during dives decreased with depth at a faster rate than estimated biomechanical costs. These results strongly support the hypothesis that function constrains form in diving birds, and that optimizing wing shape and form for wing-propelled diving leads to such high flight costs that flying ceases to be an option in larger wing-propelled diving seabirds, including penguins.},

   abstract = {Migration is a widespread strategy for escaping unfavourable conditions during winter, but the extent to which populations that segregate during the breeding season aggregate during the non-breeding season is poorly understood. Low non-breeding season aggregation may be associated with higher likelihood of overlap with threats, but with fewer populations affected, whereas high aggregation may result in a lower probability of exposure to threats, but higher overall severity. We investigated non-breeding distributions and extent of population aggregation in 2 sympatrically breeding auks. We deployed geolocation-immersion loggers on common guillemots Uria aalge and razorbills Alca torda at 11 colonies around the northern UK and tracked their movements across 2 non-breeding seasons (2017-18 and 2018-19). Using 290 guillemot and 135 razorbill tracks, we mapped population distributions of each species and compared population aggregation during key periods of the non-breeding season (post-breeding moult and mid-winter), observing clear interspecific differences. Razorbills were largely distributed in the North Sea, whereas guillemot distributions were spread throughout Scottish coastal waters and the North, Norwegian and Barents Seas. We found high levels of aggregation in razorbills and a strong tendency for colonyspecific distributions in guillemots. Therefore, razorbills are predicted to have a lower likelihood of exposure to marine threats, but more severe potential impact due to the larger number of colonies affected. This interspecific difference may result in divergent population trajectories, despite the species sharing protection at their breeding sites. We highlight the importance of taking wholeyear distributions into account in spatial planning to adequately protect migratory species.},

   abstract = {Governments are under increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and large-scale wind farms are being developed in marine environments worldwide. However, top predators are strongly affected by environmental change and anthropogenic activities. Common guillemots (Uria aalge, hereafter guillemots), as one of the world’s most numerous seabird species, are prone to interference with offshore wind farms (OWFs). This study assessed the cumulative impacts of all operating OWFs on guillemots in the German North Sea. These estimates were applied to quantify the possible conflicts between guillemot occurrence and current German government plans to implement large-scale OWFs. If OWFs were implemented according to the current maritime spatial plan for the German Exclusive Economic zone, they would cover 13% of the German North Sea. Guillemot numbers peak during autumn, with German North Sea offshore waters hosting approximately 90,000 individuals. Guillemot density in autumn was significantly reduced within a radius of 19.5 km around operating OWFs. Applying this disturbance distance to current installation plans, about 70% of the German North Sea would be affected, and an estimated 68% of guillemots in the German North Sea would experience habitat loss. This highlights the possible threat to guillemots in the southern North Sea if the current German government plans are implemented. The current estimates are highly relevant to decisions regarding marine spatial planning and management recommendations. Such evaluations are essential for developing sustainable scenarios including reducing the human CO2 footprint, whilst also conserving biodiversity.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated the impact of small boat traffic on reaction distances of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), in the marine waters of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, British Columbia, Canada. Observers on moving boats recorded the minimum distance the boat came to murrelets on the water, and any disturbance reaction (fly, dive, no reaction). Out of the 7500 interactions 11.7% flew, 30.8% dove and 58.1% exhibited no flushing reaction. Using a product-limit analysis, we developed curves for the proportion of Marbled Murrelets flushing (dive or flight) as a function of reaction distance. Overall, the majority of Marbled Murrelets waited until boats were within 40 m before reacting, with 25% of the population reacting at 29.2 m. A stepwise Cox regression indicated that age, boat speed, and boat density (loaded in that order), significantly affected flushing response. More juveniles flushed than adults (70.1 versus 51.7%), but at closer distances. Faster boats caused a greater proportion of birds to flush, and at further distances (25% of birds flushed at 40 m at speeds >29 kph versus 28 m at speeds <12 kph). A stepwise logistic regression on diving and flight responses indicated that birds tended to fly completely out of feeding areas at the approach of boats travelling >28.8 kph and later in the season (July and August). Other secondary variables included; boat density and time of day. Discussion focused on possible management actions such as the application of speed limits, set back distances, and exclusion of boat traffic to protect Marbled Murrelets. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The ability of individual animals to balance their energy budgets throughout the annual cycle is important for their survival, reproduction and population dynamics. However, the annual cycles of many wild, mobile animals are difficult to observe and our understanding of how individuals balance their energy budgets throughout the year therefore remains poor. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to investigate how key components of animal energy budgets (namely individual energy gain and storage) varied in space and time. Our model used biologger-derived estimates of time-activity budgets, locations and energy expenditure to infer year-round time series of energy income and reserves. The model accounted for seasonality in environmental drivers such as sea surface temperature and daylength, allowing us to identify times and locations of high energy gain. Our study system was a population of common guillemots Uria aalge breeding at a western North Sea colony. These seabirds manage their energy budgets by adjusting their behaviour and accumulating fat reserves. However, typically during severe weather conditions, birds can experience an energy deficit over a sustained period, leading to starvation and large-scale mortality events. We show that guillemot energy gain varied in both time and space. Estimates of guillemot body mass varied throughout the annual cycle and birds periodically experienced losses in mass. Mass losses were likely to have either been adaptive, or due to energetic bottlenecks, the latter leading to increased susceptibility to mortality. Guillemots tended to be lighter towards the edge of their spatial distribution. We describe a framework that combines biologging data, time-activity budget analysis and Bayesian state-space modelling to identify times and locations of high energetic reward or potential energetic bottlenecks in a wild animal population. Our approach can be extended to address ecological and conservation-driven questions that were previously unanswerable due to logistical complexities in collecting data on wild, mobile animals across full annual cycles.

   abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs, also known as agent-based models) are mechanistic models in which demographic population trends emerge from processes at the individual level. IBMs are used instead of more aggregated approaches whenever one or more of the following aspects are deemed too relevant to be ignored: Intraspecific trait variation, local interactions, adaptive behaviour, and response to spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments, which often results in nonlinear feedbacks. IBMs offer a high degree of flexibility and therefore vary widely in structure and resolution, depending on the research question, system under investigation, and available data. Data used to parameterise an IBM can be divided into two categories: Species and environmental data. Unlike other model types, qualitative empirical knowledge can be taken into account via probabilistic rules. IBM flexibility is often associated with higher number of parameters and hence higher uncertainty; therefore sensitivity analysis and validation are extremely important tools for analysing these models. The chapter presents three examples: A vole-mustelid model used to understand the mechanisms underlying population cycles in rodents; a wild boar-virus model to study persistence of wildlife diseases in heterogeneous landscapes; and a wild tobacco-moth caterpillar model to study emergence of delayed chemical plant defence against insect herbivores. These examples demonstrate the ability of IBMs to decipher mechanisms driving observed phenomena at the population level and their role in planning applied conservation measures. IBMs typically require more data and effort than other model types, but rewards in terms of structural realism, understanding, and decision support are high.},

   abstract = {The non-breeding season presents significant energetic challenges to birds that breed in temperate or polar regions, with clear implications for population dynamics. In seabirds, the environmental conditions at non-breeding sites drive food availability and the energetic cost of regulatory processes, resulting in variation in diet, behaviour and energetics; however, very few studies have attempted to understand if and how these aspects vary between populations. We investigated whether non-breeding location influenced diet, behaviour and energetics in the common guillemot Uria aalge. We studied guillemots from four UK breeding colonies, two located on the west coast of Scotland and two on the east. We quantified non-breeding distribution, foraging behaviour and activity budgets of 39 individuals from July to March, using geolocation–immersion loggers and time-depth recorders, and used feather stable isotope signatures to infer diet during the post-breeding moult. We calculated energy expenditure and investigated whether the peak (an indicator of the potential vulnerability to marine threats) varied between colonies. Individuals were spatially segregated according to the coastline they breed on, with west coast guillemots distributed off the west coast of the UK and east coast guillemots distributed off the east coast. Diet and behaviour were more similar in guillemots that shared a breeding coastline than those that did not, as west coast guillemots foraged at a lower trophic level, spent less time diving and engaged in more pelagic foraging than east coast guillemots. However, energy expenditure was remarkably similar between colonies, peaking during late February/early March, indicating that, during our study period, there was high synchrony between colonies in the timing of potential vulnerability to marine threats. Therefore, any anthropogenic changes that result in decreased food availability or increased energy expenditure during late winter may have greater impacts on energy balance, with consequences for population dynamics.},

However, complex movement or observation process models often necessitate custom and computationally demanding HMM model-fitting techniques that are impractical for most practitioners, and there is a paucity of generalized user-friendly software available for implementing multivariate HMMs of animal movement.

It therefore facilitates more realistic hypothesis-driven animal movement analyses that have hitherto been largely inaccessible to non-statisticians.

   abstract = {1 Summary 1. Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) have become an immensely popular tool for inferring latent animal behaviors from telemetry data, largely because they are relatively fast and easy to implement when data streams are observed without error and at regular time intervals. While movement HMMs typically rely solely on location data, auxiliary biotelemetry and environmental data are powerful and readily-available resources for incorporating much more behavioral realism and inferring ecological relationships that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to infer from location data alone. However, there is a paucity of generalized user-friendly software available for implementing (multivariate) HMMs of animal movement. Furthermore, location measurement error, temporal irregularity, and other forms of missing data are often pervasive in telemetry studies (particularly in marine systems). 2. Here we provide a guide to using an open-source R package, momentuHMM version 1.5.4, that addresses many of the deficiencies in existing software. Features for mul-tivariate HMMs in momentuHMM (pronounced "momentum") include: 1) tools for data pre-processing and visualization; 2) user-specified probability distributions for an unlimited number of data streams and latent behavior states, such as those based on location (e.g., step length, turning angle) and auxiliary biotelemetry data (e.g., from pressure, conductivity, heart rate, or motion sensors); 3) biased and correlated random walk movement models, including "activity centers" associated with attractive or repulsive forces; 4) user-specified design matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of initial distribution, state transition probability, and probability distribution parameters using linear model formulas familiar to most R users; 5) multiple impu-tation methods that account for observation error attributable to measurement error and temporally-irregular or missing data; 6) seamless integration of spatio-temporal covariate raster data; 7) cosinor and spline regression formulas for cyclical (e.g., daily, seasonal) and other complicated patterns; 8) discrete individual-level random effects on state transition probabilities; 9) hierarchical hidden Markov models for data streams and/or state switching at multiple time scales; 10) "recharge" models for an aggregated physiological process associated with state switching in heterogeneous environments; 11) model checking and selection; and 12) data simulation capabilities for study design, power analyses and assessing model performance, including simulation of location data subject to movement constraints (e.g. land for marine animals), temporal irregularity, 2 and/or measurement error. 3. After providing a brief introduction to (multivariate) HMMs for telemetry data, we demonstrate some of the capabilities of momentuHMM using real-world examples.

Large datasets of invididual locations often remain unused or used only in part due to the lack of practical models that can directly infer the desired features from raw GPS locations and the complexity of existing approaches. Some of them being disputed for their lack of biological justifications in their design. We propose a simple model of individual movement with explicit parameters, based on a two-dimensional biased and correlated random walk with three forces related to advection (correlation), attraction (bias) and immobility of the animal. These forces can be directly estimated using individual data. We demonstrate the approach by using GPS data of 5 red deer with a high frequency sampling. The results show that a simple random walk template can account for the spatial complexity of wild animals. The practical design of the model is also verified for detecting spatial feature abnormalities and for providing estimates of density and abundance of wild animals. Integrating even more additional features of animal movement, such as individuals’ interactions or environmental repellents, could help to better understand the spatial behavior of wild animals.},

Projecting responses of organisms and populations to these novel environmental conditions often requires extrapolations beyond observed conditions, challenging the predictive limits of statistical modeling capabilities. Bioenergetics modeling provides the mechanistic basis for projecting climate change effects on marine living resources in novel conditions, has a long history of development, and has been applied widely to fish and other taxa. We provide our perspective on 4 opportunities that will advance the ability of bioenergetics-based models to depict changes in the productivity and distribution of fishes and other marine organisms, leading to more robust projections of climate impacts. These are (1) improved depiction of bioenergetics processes to derive realistic individual-level response(s) to complex changes in environmental conditions, (2) innovations in scaling individual-level bioenergetics to project responses at the population and food web levels, (3) more realistic coupling between spatial dynamics and bioenergetics to better represent the local- to regional-scale differences in the effects of climate change on the spatial distributions of organisms, and (4) innovations in model validation to ensure that the next generation of bioenergetics-based models can be used with known and sufficient confidence. Our focus on specific opportunities will enable critical advancements in bioenergetics modeling and position the modeling community to make more accurate and robust projections of the effects of climate change on individuals, populations, food webs, and ecosystems.},

Individuals differ from each other in distinct ways and among themselves during different stages of their life cycle. Properties at higher levels—populations, communities, and ecosystems—emerge from these individual interactions and the interactions with their environment. Since individuals within ecological systems do have self-direction and the ability to adapt, IBMs are one way to capture this complexity. IBMs allow more detail and flexibility for individual action than the traditional compartment modeling approach. The key factors in an IBM are: (1) the inclusion of individual variation including detail about the life history and age classes, (2) the possibility for agents to adapt and learn (that is, update in real time the interaction rules) from experiences, and (3) the modification of the environment by the behavior of the individual.},

   abstract = {Human activities can influence the movement of organisms, either repelling or attracting individuals depending on whether they interfere with natural behavioural patterns or enhance access to food. To discern the processes affecting such interactions, an appropriate analytical approach must reflect the motivations driving behavioural decisions at multiple scales. In this study, we developed a modelling framework for the analysis of foraging trips by central place foragers. By recognising the distinction between movement phases at a larger scale and movement steps at a finer scale, our model can identify periods when animals are actively following moving attractors in their landscape. We applied the framework to GPS tracking data of northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis, paired with contemporaneous fishing boat locations, to quantify the putative scavenging activity of these seabirds on discarded fish and offal. We estimated the rate and scale of interaction between individual birds and fishing boats and the interplay with other aspects of a foraging trip. The model classified periods when birds were heading out to sea, returning towards the colony or following the closest boat. The probability of switching towards a boat declined with distance and varied depending on the phase of the trip. The maximum distance at which a bird switched towards the closest boat was estimated around 35 km, suggesting the use of olfactory information to locate food. Individuals spent a quarter of a foraging trip, on average, following fishing boats, with marked heterogeneity among trips and individuals. Our approach can be used to characterise interactions between central place foragers and different anthropogenic or natural stimuli. The model identifies the processes influencing central place foraging at multiple scales, which can improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying movement behaviour and characterise individual variation in interactions with a range of human activities that may attract or repel these species. Therefore, it can be adapted to explore the movement of other species that are subject to multiple dynamic drivers.},

   abstract = {The Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol for describing Individual-and Agent-Based Models (ABMs) is now widely accepted and used to document such models in journal articles. As a standardized document for providing a consistent, logical and readable account of the structure and dynamics of ABMs, some research groups also find it useful as a workflow for model design. Even so, there are still limitations to ODD that obstruct its more widespread adoption. Such limitations are discussed and addressed in this paper: the limited availability of guidance on how to use ODD; the length of ODD documents; limitations of ODD for highly complex models; lack of sufficient details of many ODDs to enable reimplementation without access to the model code; and the lack of provision for sections in the document structure covering model design ratio-nale, the model’s underlying narrative, and the means by which the model’s fitness for purpose is evaluated. We document the steps we have taken to provide better guidance on: structuring complex ODDs and an ODD summary for inclusion in a journal article (with full details in supplementary material; Table 1); using ODD to point readers to relevant sections of the model code; update the document structure to include sections on model rationale and evaluation. We also further advocate the need for standard descriptions of simulation experiments and argue that ODD can in principle be used for any type of simulation model. Thereby ODD would provide a lingua franca for simulation modelling.},

   abstract = {Background: Individual-based models (IBMs) are useful to simulate events subject to stochasticity and/or heterogeneity, and have become well established to model the potential (re)emergence of pathogens (e.g., pandemic influenza, bioterrorism). Individual heterogeneity at the host and pathogen level is increasingly documented to influence transmission of endemic diseases and it is well understood that the final stages of elimination strategies for vaccine-preventable childhood diseases (e.g., polio, measles) are subject to stochasticity. Even so it appears IBMs for both these phenomena are not well established. We review a decade of IBM publications aiming to obtain insights in their advantages, pitfalls and rationale for use and to make recommendations facilitating knowledge transfer within and across disciplines. Methods: We systematically identified publications in Web of Science and PubMed from 2006-2015 based on title/abstract/keywords screening (and full-text if necessary) to retrieve topics, modeling purposes and general specifications. We extracted detailed modeling features from papers on established vaccine-preventable childhood diseases based on full-text screening. Results: We identified 698 papers, which applied an IBM for infectious disease transmission, and listed these in a reference database, describing their general characteristics. The diversity of disease-topics and overall publication frequency have increased over time (38 to 115 annual publications from 2006 to 2015). The inclusion of intervention strategies (8 to 52) and economic consequences (1 to 20) are increasing, to the detriment of purely theoretical explorations. Unfortunately, terminology used to describe IBMs is inconsistent and ambiguous. We retrieved 24 studies on a vaccine-preventable childhood disease (covering 7 different diseases), with publication frequency increasing from the first such study published in 2008. IBMs have been useful to explore heterogeneous between- and within-host interactions, but combined applications are still sparse. The amount of missing information on model characteristics and study design is remarkable. Conclusions: IBMs are suited to combine heterogeneous within- and between-host interactions, which offers many opportunities, especially to analyze targeted interventions for endemic infections. We advocate the exchange of (open-source) platforms and stress the need for consistent "branding". Using (existing) conventions and reporting protocols would stimulate cross-fertilization between research groups and fields, and ultimately policy making in decades to come.},

   abstract = {The 'ODD' (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol was published in 2006 to standardize the published descriptions of individual-based and agent-based models (ABMs). The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {We propose a continuous-time version of the correlated random walk model for animal telemetry data. The continuous-time formulation allows data that have been nonuniformly collected over time to be modeled without subsampling, interpolation, or aggregation to obtain a set of locations uniformly spaced in time. The model is derived from a continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity process that is integrated to form a location process. The continuous-time model was placed into a state-space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

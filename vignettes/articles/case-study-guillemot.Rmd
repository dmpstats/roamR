# Overview
Here we use `roamR` to simulate the movement and energetics for a population of common guillemot (_Uria aalge_) on the Isle of May. For details on the `romaR` package, refer to the general guide (XX), with the general achitecture repeated here:

![roamR arhitecture](/images/roamR_schema.png)


The simulations here cover the non-breeding season (some 9 months from X to X) under two broad scenarios:

* An environment free of Off-Shore Windfarms (OWFs) - nominally the status quo
* An environment with many synthetic OWF developments 

The overall intention is to quantify the effects of potential displacement from these developments, based on counter-factual comparisons of animal's condition under these scenarios. In keeping with the architecture of the `roamR` package, the following main components will be populated:

* __IBM general settings__ (`ModelConfig`) sundry high-level controls for the simulation, such as the number of agents, broad spatial boundaries, spatial projections, time-steps, start & finish dates.
* __Species-level information__ (`Species`) such as distributions governing initial bodymass, what behavioural states are possible, movement parameters, and how agents respond to their environment e.g.  avoidance of windfarms or landmass, costs associated with activity.
* __Drivers__ (`Driver`) descriptions/data that define the environment that agents may interact with or respond to e.g. sea surface temperatures, locations of windfarms, coastlines, prey fields etc.

The extent to which these can be populated will obviously vary, with the guillemot chosen here as a population that is relatively well studied. `roamR` is intentionally general and has substantial functionality that will not be used in a simulation. We will populate various elements of the simulation in turn, before turning to running the simulation and post-processing the results.


# Input data
As a relatively well-studied species/population, there are many `roamR` elements to populate. Mainly these are

* Density maps
* SST
* Activity data
* Energetics
* Redistribution rates
* Bodyweight
* Mortality
* Bodymass conversion

which will be a) described in detail and b) specified in `roamR` forms in the following sections. `roamR` can be run with very little data (an example of a more data sparse species is given in the test study XX), with the results being correspondingly less informative and stochastic.


## IBM configuration

In the interest of speed, the example simulation here will not be large in terms of the number of agents to run - we'll opt for 10 agents (`n_agents`). The non-breeding season for these animals runs from approximately start of July for 9 months (`start_date`, `end_date`). We'll opt for a uniform 1km^2 spatial resolution (`x_delta`, `y_delta`) and have everything operate on the UTM 30N coordinate system (`ref_sys`). Note, this will be the basis of ingesting and aligning the general spatial inputs e.g. spatio-temporal density maps will be converted to 1km^2 UTM 30N data-cubes when initialising the IBM. The `sf` package is generally used for dealing with spatial data (and the interlinked `stars` package for spatio-temporal).


```{r}
# UTM zone 30N
utm30 <- st_crs(32630)

```

The location of the isle of may colony is simply defined here in lat/long by the island's location:


```{r}
# location of colony - start/finish locations
isle_may <- st_sf(
  id = "Isle of May",
  prop = 1,
  geom = st_sfc(st_point(c(-2.5667, 56.1833))),
  crs = 4326
)
```


In terms of bounding the entire simulation spatially, we've opted for a bounding box from X to X. Note this a hard boundary in terms of simulations - data outside this will have no influence. The resulting configuration (a `ModelConfig` object called `guill_ibm-config`) is:

```{r}
# AoC in UTM. Exact figures come from a previous lat/lon example
AoC <- st_bbox(c(xmin = 178831, ymin = 5906535,  xmax = 1174762, ymax = 6783609), crs = st_crs(utm30))
```


Start and end sites are well defined here, as we are operating on the IoM colony. The completed IBM configuration is:


```{r}

# IBM Settings - assume fixed for these simulations

guill_ibm_config <- ModelConfig(
  n_agents = 10,
  ref_sys = utm30,
  aoc_bbx = AoC, 
  delta_x = 1000,
  delta_y = 1000,
  time_step = "1 day",
  start_date = date("2025-07-01"),
  end_date = date("2025-07-01") + 270, 
  start_sites = isle_may |> st_transform(utm30),
  end_sites = isle_may |> st_transform(utm30)
)


```

#' `<AgentState>`
#'
#' `AgentState` is an S4 class for specifying an agent's current state in terms
#' of spatio-temporal location and physiological condition at the end of the
#' current simulation `time_step` (e.g. end of day). It stores information such
#' as body mass, activity budgets, energy expenditure metrics, survival status,
#' etc
#'
#' @slot location object of class `XY`, specifying the agent's current spatial
#'   coordinates (units/projection: TBD).
#' @slot grid_cell object of class `XY`, indicating the spatial coordinates of
#'   the grid-cell occupied by the agent
#' @slot time_step integer, the current simulation time-step
#' @slot body_mass numeric, the agent's current body mass (grams)
#' @slot activity_budget list, defining the agent's time-in-activity budget in
#'   the current time-step. Each list element represents an activity and the
#'   time the agent spends on it during this time-step (hours/time-step).
#' @slot activity_costs list, specifying the energy costs associated with each
#'   activity in argument `activity_budget` (KJ/hour/g)
#' @slot energy_expenditure numeric, total energy spent on all activities by the
#'   end of the current time-step (KJ/g)
#' @slot foraging_success numeric, the mass of prey consumed per time-step
#'   (g/time-step)
#' @slot mass_change_value numeric, specifying the change in the agentâ€™s mass
#'   over the time-step (grams)
#' @slot mortality_prob numeric, the probability of the agent dying within the
#'   the current time-step
#' @slot alive integer, binary indicator of the agent's survival status (`1` if
#'   alive, `0` if dead)
#' @slot track object of class `sf`, containing time-location points that
#'   represent the agent's movement in the current time-step
